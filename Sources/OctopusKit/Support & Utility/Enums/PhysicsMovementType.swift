    /// A continuous force to a physics body that must be re-applied on every frame update to maintain movement.
    ///
    /// A *force* is applied for a length of time based on the amount of simulation time that passes between when you apply the force and when the next frame of the simulation is processed. So, to apply a continuous force to an body, you need to make the appropriate method calls each time a new frame is processed. Forces are usually used for continuous effects.

    /// An instantaneous change to a physics bodyâ€™s velocity, generally applied only once or in discrete steps.
    ///
    /// An *impulse* makes an instantaneous change to the bodyâ€™s velocity that is independent of the amount of simulation time that has passed. Impulses are usually used for immediate changes to a bodyâ€™s velocity.
